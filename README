## Notes

Our big idea was to make a heat map for LambdaMan to follow around the board,
but we didn't have time to finish porting our prototypes into the Lambda syntax.
Lambda man tries to follow runs of pills, then wander to next batches of pills.
Our Lambda Man language has a lot of features, probably a few too many.

Our ghosts focus on the case by measuring distance to Lambda and prioriting the
longest distance.  We were working on a memory of past moves for the ghosts to
keep them from gettin stuck into making the same moves.  The ghost language is a
simple pre-parser.
